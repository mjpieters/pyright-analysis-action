inputs:
  report:
    description: >
      Path to the Pyright verifytypes report. Must be in JSON format, so
      produced with the `--outputjson` flag.
    required: true
  div_id:
    description: >
      Provide a value for the `<div>` tag that wraps the report in the generated
      HTML page. If omitted, a random UUID is used.
  comment_on_pr:
    description: >
      If set to `true` (or `yes`, or `1`, `t` or `y`), and the current workflow
      run was triggered by a `pull_request` or `workflow_run` event indirectly
      triggered by a `pull_request`, then a comment will be added to that pull
      request. If there already is a comment posted by this action then the
      existing comment is updated instead. Requires a github token with either
      `issues: write` or `pull-requests: write` permission. Note that a
      `pull_request` workflow running in a forked repo will only get a read-only
      token so you'll need to put this action in a `workflow_run` workflow
      instead. See the action documentation for details.
    default: "false"
  github_token:
    description: >
      The github token to use when posting a comment on a PR. Defaults to the
      `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for this workflow job.
    default: ${{ github.token }}
